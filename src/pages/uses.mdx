{/* !start-of-preview */}

This page lists the things that I use in my daily life. It is not exhaustive by
any means. I only include things that I think are noteworthy. This page also
serves as a my personal reference as well, in case I need to redo my setup in
the future OR upgrade in the future.

## Hardwares

### Computers üñ•Ô∏è

1. Windows 10 PC

   - CPU: Intel i5-14600K
   - Memory: 128 GB DDR4
   - SSD:
     - 1TB Samsung EVO 870 (Boot drive)
     - 2TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus (Work stuff, WSL2, Docker, etc.)
     - 4TB Samsung EVO 870 (Games and other stuff)

   This PC started off as my gaming PC to unwind after work. In mid 2022, I
   decided to upgrade it and run Ubuntu in WSL2 on it. My development workflow
   involves running a lot of Docker containers and running them on Mac wasn't a
   pleasant experience. I now run Docker on this PC with WSL2 backend, while
   still mostly writing code on my MacBook via SSH. I wrote about how to go
   about setting it up in
   [`wsl2-as-devbox`](https://github.com/jackyef/wsl2-as-devbox).

2. MacBook Pro 2024 - M4 Pro 24GB/1TB

   I finally upgraded from my 2017 MacBook Pro! I got the 24GB eventhough it is less than the previous 32GB MBP.
   I think this is fine because I am using my Windows PC as the devbox anyway.
   I got the nano-texture display and it has been an absolute joy to use this machine when I am on-the-go!
   Harsh lighting conditions are no longer a problem.

### Displays üì∫

I am using a [AORUS FO27Q3](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3) as my primary display. OLED isn't the best for productivity,
but I gave into the temptation because I love good blacks when gaming. I have a
[21-inch Acer](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/HK/content/model/UM.WE1CF.001) as a
secondary. I also have a [27-inch LG](https://www.lg.com/id/monitor/lg-27gp850-b) which is currently used as a 
substitute, but I may be replacing the 21-inch Acer with this soon. 

I used to use a Dell monitor with USB-C connection and it was great! 
Though now that I don't use my MacBook that much, I replaced it with a monitor
with higher refresh rate.

## Software üìã

### Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) on Mac and
[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) on my Windows PC. Both
are set up with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) just because it
comes with some quality of life improvements out-of-the-box, 2 of my most
favorite one being `git` aliases and not having to type `cd` everytime üòÑ.

I don't have a lot of customization in the `.zshrc` file, here is the addition I
have to the default `.zshrc`:

```shell
# Adds docker-compose plugin
# Allows for aliases like: dce, dcup, dcdn, dclf, etc.
plugins=(git docker-compose)

# Some aliases for less keystrokes
alias gpuo="git push -u origin"
alias gpuo="git push -u origin"
alias dclfs="docker-compose logs -f --since 0m"
alias dcrr="docker-compose run --rm"

# Clean up branches excluding the provided args
# e.g.: `gbclean develop` will delete all branches except `master` and `develop`
gbclean() {
  exclude_branches="master"
  if [[ -n $1 ]]; then
    exclude_branches="$exclude_branches|$1"
  fi
  gb | cut -c 3- | grep -vE "$exclude_branches" | xargs git branch -D
}


# Customizing prompt so I know I am currently in an SSH session in my WSL2 instance
# I only do this on my WSL2 instance
PROMPT="%{$fg[grey]%}[%D{%f/%m/%y} %D{%L:%M:%S}] %{$fg[green]%}%n@%{$fg[cyan]%}%m%{$reset_color%} ${PROMPT}"
```

### Code editor

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Unfortunately I just
never got into using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) üòÖ

VSCode has excellent SSH and WSL support which makes everything very seamless
even when coding from different computers. One day, I might even
[set up VSCode server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2viJSYyKio) so I can
code from my iPad.

Some extensions that I install on VSCode:

1. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
2. [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
3. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4. [GitHub (yes, the deprecated one)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KnisterPeter.vscode-github)
5. [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
6. [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
7. [:emojisense:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)
8. [styled-jsx](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blanu.vscode-styled-jsx),
   when I am working on codebase that uses it
9. [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss),
   also when I am working on codebase that uses it

### Web browsers

I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as my primary web browser. On
Mac, I also use
[Arc, a browser by The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) for web
sites/apps that I tend to keep open for a longer time.
[I tweeted about how I am using Arc a while back](https://twitter.com/jackyef__/status/1546745567455629314).

### Some notable web apps

1. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), for note-taking and personal journal.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com), I have a private repo named `growth` on GitHub
   where I put technical things that I plan to learn/do for self-improvement.
3. [Cal.com](https://cal.com), the scheduling infrastructure that I use on
   [/chat](/chat).
4. [omatsuri.app](https://omatsuri.app/), various handy tools for web
   development.

### Some handy Mac apps

1. [Pandan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pandan/id1569600264?mt=12), I use
   Pandan to alert me every 20 minutes, after which I will take a short break to
   avoid me sitting and staring at the computer for too long.
2. [Hand Mirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12),
   a handy app to give myself a quick access to the webcam.
3. [Gifox](https://gifox.io/), my go-to app to record a short GIF.
4. [Cron](https://cron.com/), a simply better calendar experience (also
   available on Windows!)
